# Ready-Reckoner-A-COVID-19-Chatbot-CFC2020
Problem Statement :
In times of crisis, communications systems are often overwhelmed with people trying to find basic information about testing, symptoms, community response, and other resources. When communication lines get clogged, people who need real help can't get through. Chatbots help respond to tens, even hundreds, of thousands of messages a day.

How can IBM Cloud Service help :
IBM Watson Assistant service is an AI service in IBM Cloud that helps you build, train, and deploy conversational interactions into any application, device, or channel. Creating a Chabot using Watson Assistant can help address the issues that our users face while trying to gather accurate, relevant information. Whether you're trying to learn the latest news about Covid-19 or learn where there's testing in your area, a Chabot can play a major role in helping communities quickly understand crucial information and free up customer service resources to focus on higher-level issues. This document shows you how to create a crisis communication Chabot using IBM Watson Assistant.
Watson’s assistant provides API’s to integrate your chatbot to your custom Application it may be Mobile/Web/Desktop and you can also integrate into various channels like Facebook messenger, Slack, etc.

The Idea :
COVID-19 has citizens looking for answers about symptoms and testing sites as well as current status of schools, transportation, and other public services. Using Watson Assistant designed a virtual assistant pre-loaded to understand and respond to common questions about COVID-19, scan COVID-19 news articles using Watson Discovery and respond to COVID statistics inquires with data from trusted sources.
Next integrate the chatbot in an IBM Cloud hosted web server, using a Slack integration or Mobile integration using android studio( with speech to text & text to speech IBM cloud service feature)

How do Chatbots work:

1.In the very first step, user input is given to the AI layer, which has an NLP unit and a Decision Engine.
2.The NLP (Natural Language Processing) unit understands user intent & context i.e. what exactly the user is asking for and based on that it converts user input into machine understandable language and processes it to a decision engine.
3.Decision Engine Based on the NLP output Decision Engine uses machine-learning algorithms to decide the bot response and process that response to the NLG unit
4.NLG (Natural Language Generation) unit as the name suggest converts Machine Language into a plain text or human-understandable language.
5.Finally, the output of the NLG unit is our Chatbot response, which is processed to the user.
