Integrate your COVID-19 chatbot with Slack
Now letâ€™s deploy it to Slack. Slack is a cloud-based messaging application that helps people collaborate with one another. After you configure a dialog skill and add it to an assistant, you can integrate the assistant with Slack.
When integrated, depending on the events that you configure the assistant to support, your assistant can respond to questions that are asked in direct messages or in channels where the assistant is directly mentioned.
